# Blockly (Microsoft MakeCode fork)

This is a fork of [Blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly/), an open source visual programming environment.
The fork is maintained by the Microsoft MakeCode team, and is used to power the blocks environment in [PXT](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt).

This concrete version has an implementation of an arduino code generator. The changes are visible in /generators/arduino and /generators/arduino/
This is a WIP, many files are added manually and this is not a final implementation. This repo is used mainly for testing and control version.
